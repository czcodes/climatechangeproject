## Extrapolating Carbon Emissions To 2050

## Project Product: https://github.com/czcodes/climatechangeproject/files/7850912/carbonemissions.pdf

Using Python and its numpy and linear_progression libraries, this project plots data about varying countries' carbon emissions over the years, and using linear 
and polynomial regression it predicts their future emissions in the future.
